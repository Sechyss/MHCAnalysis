  """
  This function runs a model of the evolution of T cell and antibody responses to a pathogen.

  Args:
    RunTime: The number of years to run the model.
    BackgroundMortProb: The probability of death from background causes.
    num_new_births: The number of new births per year.
    probRecover: The probability of recovering from infection.
    contactrateperday: The average number of contacts per day between individuals.
    infprob: The probability of infection per contact.
    randomintrodprob: The probability of a new strain of the pathogen being introduced each year.
    InfectionMortProb: The probability of death from infection.
    probMakeAntibody: The probability of an individual making an antibody to the pathogen.
    probMakeTcell: The probability of an individual making a T cell response to the pathogen.
    probmut: The probability of a mutation occurring in the pathogen each year.
    probRecomb: The probability of a recombination event occurring in the pathogen each year.
    record_interval: The number of years between each time step at which the model is recorded.

  Returns:
    A tuple of the following:
      - The number of individuals in the population at each time step.
      - The number of infections at each time step.
      - The number of deaths from infection at each time step.
      - The number of individuals with antibodies to the pathogen at each time step.
      - The number of individuals with T cell responses to the pathogen at each time step.
